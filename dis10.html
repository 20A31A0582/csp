        <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
                 -> severely stunted plants<br>
                 ->excessive tillering<br>
                 ->very upright plant growth<br>
                 ->grassy and rosette appearance of plants<br>
                 ->yellowish green leaves that are shorter and narrower than normal<br>
                 ->leaves that remain yellow even after application of sufficient nitrogen fertilizers<br>
                 ->numerous small rusty spots or patches on leaves, which merge into blotches<br>
                 -> leaves have a mottled appearance<br>

<h2>Management:</h2>
    <p>-> To control rice grassy stunt virus the brown planthopper <br>
               vectors need to be managed. This can be done either through the <br>
               use of insecticides, brown plant hopper-resistant varieties, or synchronized <br>
               crop establishment. Infected stubble needs to be plowed under after harvest to reduce the virus source..<br>
