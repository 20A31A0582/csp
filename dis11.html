    <p>  <h1>Bacterial leaf streak</h1>
        <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
                  ->Symptoms initially appear as small, water-soaked,<br>
                   linear lesions between leaf veins.These streaks are initially <br>
                   dark green and later become light brown to yellowish gray.<br>
                  ->The lesions are translucent when held against the light.<br>
                  ->Entire leaves may become brown and die when the disease is very severe.<br>
                  ->Under humid conditions, yellow droplets of bacterial <br>
                   ooze, which contain masses of bacterial cells, may be observed on the surface of leaves.<br>
                  ->leaf streak lesions are usually thinner than those of narrow brown spot<br>
                  ->narrow brown spot lesions are not translucent, nor do they produce bacterial ooze<br>

<h2>Management:</h2>
    <p>-> Plant resistant varieties.<br>
           ->Treat seeds with hot water.<br>
           ->Keep fields cleanâ€”remove weed hosts and plow under <br>
            rice stubble, straw, rice ratoons, and volunteer seedlings, which may be infected by the bacteria.<br>
           ->Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen.<br>
           ->Ensure good drainage of fields (in conventionally flooded crops) and nurseries.<br>
           ->Drain the field during severe flood.<br>
          ->Dry the field during the fallow period to kill the bacteria in the soil and in plant residues.<br>
          ->In cases of severe infection, when yield may be affected, <br>
          a copper-based fungicide applied at heading can be effective in controlling the disease.<br>
