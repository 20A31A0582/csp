    <p>  <h1>Narrow brown leaf spot </h1>
         <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
        ->varies in severity from year to year<br>
          and is more severe as rice plants approach maturity<br>      
        ->Leaf spotting may become very severe on the more<br>
          susceptible varieties, and the disease causes severe<br>
          leaf necrosis<br>
         ->On upper leaf sheaths, symptoms are similar to those<br>
          found on the leaf.<br>
        ->On lower sheaths, the symptom is a<br>
          “net blotch” or spot in which cell walls are dark brown<br>
          and intracellular areas are tan to yellow<br>

<h2>Management:</h2>
    <p> ->Remove weeds and weedy rice in the field and nearby areas to<br>
        remove alternate hosts that allow the fungus to survive and infect new rice crops<br>
        ->Use balanced nutrients; make sure that adequate potassium is used.<br>
        ->Use fungicides (e.g., iprodione, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and carbendazim) as seed treatments.<br>
        ->Treat seeds with hot water (53−54°C) for 10−12 minutes before planting, to control primary infection at the seedling stage.<br>
